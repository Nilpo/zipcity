Zip code info script

This is a script to obtain the city and state for a given zip code,
and autocomplete the zip code on a form. It utilizes a zip code sqlite
database and a basic perl CGI script to query the zip codes. For the
autocompletion, it uses the jQuery library and the autocomplete plugin
from http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/.

The perl script supports querying by any combination of city, state
and zip code to find the set of city, state and zip codes that
match. Currently the city and state are set up to be exact
(case-insensitive) matches and the zip must be a prefix of the actual
zip code.

For those who do not wish to use sqlite, there is a version using flat
files, with the zip codes split up into 100 files named by the first 2
digits of the zip code. This lets us search for any particular zip
code or set of zip codes much faster than using the whole file.
